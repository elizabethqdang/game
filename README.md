# Name of Game

## MVP
Typing game that measures your typing WPM. The player has to correctly type all of the words on the screen before the time is up. If the player finishes, then he/she proceeds to the next level, where the difficulty of words increases. They're will be 10 levels. Words will continueously spawn (The semantics are a work in progres).

1. Words will spawn until the player loses or the time alotted in the round ends.
2. There will be 10 levels, increasing in word difficulty.
3. High Score Board displays at the end? Or maybe just an option to reset the game?

This app will onsist of a single sreen with game board, game controls and a nav link to my Github and eventually a link to my LinkedIn. The game controll will allow the player to reset the game as well as see the high score board?
